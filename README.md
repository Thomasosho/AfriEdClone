# Winery Clone Application

Welcome to the Winery Clone Application! This project is a ReactJS application built with Vite, designed to mimic the functionality and design of a winery website. If you're looking to create a beautiful and user-friendly winery website, you're in the right place.

## Features

- **Homepage**: A visually appealing homepage showcasing your winery's branding, featured wines, and special offers.
- **About Us**: Share the story of your winery and the passionate people behind it.

## Figma Design

We've designed the user interface for this application using Figma. You can access the design by following this [[Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/rLTUxrQyytDgsIcZXnieSG/Website-Clone?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=VEpAW3V5aoKCYTMN-1)]([insert_figma_link_here](https://www.figma.com/file/rLTUxrQyytDgsIcZXnieSG/Website-Clone?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=VEpAW3V5aoKCYTMN-1)). Feel free to use it as a reference to match the UI and UX of your winery website.
